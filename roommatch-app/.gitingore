For my thesis I will be exploring the use cases of Buddhism and Technology on a global scale. For me the contrast of Buddhist culture and Technology are quite Stark. My initial thesis is how does the interference of Technology affect the long rooted traditions that exist within Buddhist culture. For many the understanding of Buddhism is one that is existing in solidarity without the external influence of global socio-economic political and other factors. I am no different in my understanding as I perceive Buddhist culture as one often removed from external events that exists within the world as I continue to explore the effect of technology on Buddhism I will use several sources. These sources will range from historical texts to Modern adaptions of online Buddhist culture. To get a full understanding of how the effect technology has had on Buddhism exists today and in what ways are people within the Buddhist culture responding to these changes. My argument will likely be somewhat neutral as I view the changes as both positive and negative. On one side of the spectrum people are often abandoning the traditional values of Buddhism in order to pursue a more culturally relevant path to practice. But on the other side I think change is good within most things although Buddhist roots are far ingrained in the historical context of the world the ever-changing global landscape calls for changes in everything religion is no different. As I set out to explore the effect technology has on Buddhism I will focus on three key points. The first Traditional Values and how they have changed within Buddhist culture. The second public response within Buddhism to Technologies affect on the religion. The final my interpretation of the effect technology has had on Buddhist culture. As I attempt to paint an accurate picture of Technologies affect on Buddhism and Buddhist culture, I will use sources from both sides of the argument. As one can imagine Buddhism and its followers often have quite passionate stances on the culture and its existence within Society. I will use both opposing and concurring views on technology and Buddhism in order to create the most unbiased viewpoint. It is my goal to one understand the overarching theme of Technology within Buddhism and two create a realistic and unbiased stance on the subject for my reader. Well I am no expert on the religion I will use the information provided in class as well as external sources to do this. Below I have listed several sources that I think may help me complete this task.
